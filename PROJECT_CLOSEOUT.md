# Alcast Hedge Control — Project Close‑Out Note (v1.0)

**Status:** Completed / Closed

**Date:** 2026‑01‑13

## Scope Delivered (In‑Scope)

- Integrated UI for the core operational areas (SO/PO lists, exposures, RFQs, contracts, cashflow, dashboard).
- Dashboard uses real backend APIs (no mock summary payloads) and reflects RBAC boundaries.

## Scope De‑Scoped (Explicit Non‑Requirements for v1.0)

- Timeline human collaboration layer: comments, annotations, @mentions, attachments.
- Formal exports (CSV/PDF/Excel) and reconciliation packs.
- Cashflow scenarios/sensitivity (stress / what‑if analysis).
- Multi‑level approval workflows.

## Roadmap Deferred (Future Enhancements)

- Collaboration UX on top of Timeline.
- Export bundles and downstream reconciliation integrations.
- Advanced analytics and scenario tooling.
- SSO/MFA hardening if required.

## Closure

The remaining items are either explicitly de‑scoped non‑requirements or deferred roadmap work. The initiative is formally **completed**.
