# AI_CONTEXT.md

## Purpose

This file defines the non-negotiable global context of this repository.
Any AI agent (Codex, Cursor, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) MUST read and obey this file before making any change.
This repository is the single source of truth.
Chat history, tool memory, or inferred intent are NOT authoritative.
Failure to follow this file is considered a critical error.

## Global Objective

Design, implement and maintain a financial hedge control system with institutional-grade rigor.
Priorities, in strict order:

1. Correctness
2. Financial accuracy
3. Consistency of domain model
4. Traceability and auditability
5. Stability
6. Completeness

Speed, refactoring elegance, or simplification must never override correctness.

## Business Domain — Non-Negotiable Concepts

### RFQ (Request for Quote)

An RFQ is NOT a contract.
An RFQ is NOT a hedge.
An RFQ is NOT a financial position.
An RFQ is a request phase only.

It exists solely to:

- solicit prices from counterparties
- compare quotes
- support a decision (award or cancel)

No MTM, no settlement, no exposure must ever be calculated at RFQ level.

### Trade

A Trade is always a swap.
Every trade has exactly two legs:

- one BUY
- one SELL

Legs are economically linked (against, flat against, etc.).
A trade is the economic unit of a hedge.

### Contract

A Contract represents exactly ONE trade (1:1).
A contract cannot contain multiple trades.
A contract always has two legs, inherited from the trade.

All financial calculations happen ONLY at Contract level.
Contracts are the financial anchor of the system.

### MTM (Mark-to-Market)

MTM is calculated ONLY on Contracts.

MTM must never be calculated on:

- RFQs
- Quotes
- Trades not yet contracted

MTM may be snapshotted, aggregated and consolidated, but the source remains the individual Contract.

### Deal / SO / PO / RFQ / Contract Chain

The system follows a strict financial lineage:

Deal  
└── Sales Order (SO)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└── Purchase Orders (PO) [1:N]  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└── RFQs [1:N]  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└── Contracts [1:N]  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└── MTM / Cashflow / Settlement  

Rules:

- A Deal aggregates risk and P&L
- RFQs belong to exactly one SO or PO
- An RFQ may generate multiple Contracts
- Each Contract belongs to exactly one Deal

## Architectural Intent

### Backend

Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, PostgreSQL.

Design principles:

- Explicit models
- No hidden magic
- Strong typing and clear ownership of data
- Database is authoritative

### Frontend

Frontend reflects backend truth.
No business logic duplication.
UI must respect user role boundaries.

## Execution Rules

The AI agent MUST:

- Apply changes directly to repository files
- Preserve folder structure and naming
- Extend existing patterns instead of creating new ones
- Treat the codebase as a single system, not isolated files

The AI agent MUST NOT:

- Re-architect the system
- Merge RFQ logic with Contract logic
- Move MTM calculations upstream
- Introduce shortcuts to make it work
- Rename entities to simplify explanations
- Remove features for convenience

If unsure, do nothing.

## Change Discipline

Changes must be atomic.
All references must be updated together.
No partial implementations.
No TODOs or placeholders.
No temporary fixes.

Broken correctness is worse than missing features.

## Handling Ambiguity

When ambiguity exists:

1. Re-read this file
2. Inspect existing models and migrations
3. Follow the dominant implemented pattern
4. Prefer financial correctness over convenience

Ask the user only if ambiguity cannot be resolved from the repository.

## Chat and Tool Memory Policy

Chat context is unreliable.
Tool memory is non-authoritative.
Only the repository matters.

If chat instructions conflict with the repository, the repository always wins.

## Completion Criteria

The system is complete only when:

- All contracts are correctly generated from RFQs
- MTM is fully derived from Contracts
- Aggregation by Deal is consistent
- No financial logic exists at RFQ level
- No architectural inconsistencies remain

When complete, the AI must output only:

Projeto concluído.

No commentary.

## Final Instruction

Before every action:

- Re-read this file
- Assume nothing
- Preserve financial integrity

This file overrides all implicit assumptions.
